      <h2>Comparison of Actions Based on Factors</h2>
      <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
      <div class="notes">
        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hiring a Lawyer:</strong> This option scores high for legality, time & effort, and the possibility of belief, but the cost is significant. It poses a low risk and has neutral or positive long-term implications.</li>
          <li><strong>Paying for a Replacement:</strong> It involves a relatively high cost and time & effort but remains legal and poses low risk. Long-term implications are neutral, and the possibility of belief depends on trust.</li>
          <li><strong>Running Away:</strong> This option has low cost and poses high risks. It’s illegal and could lead to significant negative long-term implications, and there’s low likelihood of others believing you.</li>
          <li><strong>Shipping the Package:</strong> While it has moderate cost, it carries significant risks and legal issues. The long-term implications are negative, and there’s a moderate chance of someone believing you depending on how it's presented.</li>
          <li><strong>Requesting Help for Your Daughter:</strong> This is the least costly and legal option. It involves moderate time & effort and has a higher chance of people believing you, with relatively positive or neutral long-term implications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This comparison helps clarify the trade-offs involved in each situation, from both practical and emotional perspectives.</p>
